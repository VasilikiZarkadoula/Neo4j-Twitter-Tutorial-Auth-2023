# Neo4j-Twitter-DB-Tutorial

This is a hands-on lab project on Neo4j. We experiment on Twitter data using Python and Neo4j. The tutorial includes the following sections:

A. Installing and setting up Neo4j

B. Population of the Neo4j graph model with the tweets that have been collected in Python

C. Performing queries that produce answers to various questions  <br />

The data model that we used to represent our Twitter data in Neo4j is depicted in the figure below
